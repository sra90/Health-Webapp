This is a very simple and basic webapp that saves your health records in the form of images and helps to categorize the records for your family as well as dsiplay them using a simple search mechanism. We need to tag each image when we upload it so that it helps us search for them quicker.

The main aim of this app is to familiarize ourselves with some of the web technologies.

This app uses node.js, mustachejs (used for templating) on the server side and uses MongoDB as a DB. On the client side we use HTML,CSS,Javascript,Jquery,Bootstrap and AJAX.

Once you download the files here you will need to install Node.js, MongoDB, Expressjs, Mongoosejs and Mustachejs.

Once this is done just go to the home directory of this app and run this command

node server.js

Now your server is running in port 8080. If you want to change to port number just edit the entry at the end of the server.js file where it says 8080.

Now just go to the browser and type http://localhost:8080/

Your application should be running now. Go ahead and explore it.
Kindly note there may be bugs here as this app is just to help us learn how to use some of the technologies used.Kindly do not use spaces before or after the comma(,) while tagging or searching.

Note: You may need to make some changes if you are using the latest npm packages.
