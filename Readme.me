This is a very simple and basic webapp that saves your health recodrs in the form of images and helps to categorize the records for your family as well as dsiplay them using a simple search mechanism. We need to tag each image when we upload it so that it helps us search for them quicker.
The main aim of this app is to familiarize ourselves with some of the web technologies.

This app uses node.js on the server side and uses MongoDB as a DB. On the client side we use HTML,CSS,Javascript,Jquery,Bootstrap and AJAX.
